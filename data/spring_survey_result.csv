I'm sure I'll be fine under any grading system, but that's because I have a very strong work background. ","I'm concerned how employers would react to this system - what would differentiate an NYU student from any other NYU student, in the absence of a GPA in the first year? Only the resume and interviews. This highly disadvantages people who go straight through from undergrad. Also, I strongly suspect private sector employers, who are risk adverse and putting a massive financial investment into their summer classes, would prefer to take students from other top schools which did have grades. When presented with two candidates with identical resumes, one of whom has a transcript with good grades on it and the other with just ""Pass,"" it makes more sense to hire the former. This system also may negatively impact people who want to clerk, since judges place high weight on grades. It also introduces an entirely arbitrary element in allowing professors to decide how many Honors to give out - which again, may affect those people who want to clerk. I could imagine people selecting class's based on the rumor mill of how many Honors a professor normally gave. 

My underlying problem with this proposal is that I think it's failing to address the real issue. We all talk about how terrible the curve is, but in life, in both the private and public sectors, we will all be evaluated relative to other people. We will not get hired or get pay raises or be promoted solely on the basis of effort and how well we've memorized certain material. The curve at NYU follows that idea - that grades are not there to reflect effort, but rather how well we can identify a professor's desired end product, and deliver it. As a professional school, which definitionally is designed not just to educate, but to place individuals into the legal *profession*, it makes a lot of sense that the grading system mirrors how we will be evaluated in our workplaces. 

To me, the real issue is the utter lack of transparency and confidence we can have in how much these grades will make a difference to our career goals. What GPA precludes us from a federal appellate court clerkship? From the Cravath's of the private sector? From working at the UN? Why is it that none of us truly know how damaging (or utterly not) a B- is? Imagine if we were all told by an authoritative source (i.e., not a 3L, but OCS or PILC or the Deans) that the median GPA at NYU is a 3.2, and that for everyone who isn't aiming for crazy prestigious things like a SCOTUS clerkship, being at or around the median is perfectly fine. Would we all still be so concerned about this curve? If we would be, that's an us problem (because we're uncomfortable not getting a As and also with being explicitly told how we compare to others) and not a grading system problem.

I already thought I was going to lose my mind last semester before I got my grades and I felt that, in studying for exams for a month, I was physically and mentally going to break from how hard I pushed myself. The outcome was really disappointing to me because I worked so hard and gathered as much information as I could in order to study properly and excel on exams. This semester, I feel very unsure of myself and kind of hopeless, as if no matter what I do my grades will not reflect my level of diligence and what I know. I am trying to do better this semester, but in a way it feels futile and everyone in higher years seems to be telling me that it is indeed futile, which is a huge source of anxiety and even depression for me around grades -- not to mention the competition that it induces, which can feel miserable and create an entirely unnecessary and unhealthy dynamic at law school. I think that's a very sad statement about law school and I don't think there is any reason that law school should have to be that way. After all, shouldn't we feel confident in our abilities? Rewarded for our hard work at NYU and the hard work it took to get here? I have to say that I am very disappointed in the law school grading system and its effects on my mental health. All this when I know that law school exams are said to be a poor test of knowledge.",Strongly Agree,Strongly Agree,Neutral,Public Interest/Government,Yes,"I think it would take a lot of pressure off and lower the feeling competition. Things would not feel so futile if the goal was ""honors"" or ""pass"" and I think it would make me spend more time thinking about the material itself rather than worrying about exam performance (i.e. anxiety about grades would take up less mental energy). I also think I could feel prouder of myself and not disappointment, which I actually think would be positive as a matter of my confidence in legal training. Confidence is something I need to feel and law school grades as is give me the exact opposite. Also, I think I would be generally happier and less stressed out.",See above. ,,White,Female,No,Prefer Not to Answer,No
