10/10/2019 11:04:35,Yes,"Get rid of the B- grade for 2L's and 3L's! It isn't necessary after 1L, and can be overused by professors. "
10/10/2019 11:04:47,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:06:30,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:07:03,Yes,"Columbia Law does not have mandatory B-minuses, yet we still do. The mandatory curve is already the main source of stress for law students and having a grade that places a huge stigma on a student’s record shouldn’t be a mandatory procedure. NYU Law is proud of its collegiality and progressive ideas but still adheres to a practice that hurts students while our peer institutions are moving away from it."
10/10/2019 11:07:56,Yes,luv you guys <3 (it's ishani lol)
10/10/2019 11:11:34,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:13:07,Yes,"Not only is the grading system unhealthy, but in my opinion, it doesn't even capture how well someone understands the material. For most issue spotter exams, you're encouraged to sloppily write down as much as you can, with little attention to organization and coherence. It's so far removed from the real world, it's ridiculous. And the fact that I feel like I have no control over the outcome gives me a lot of anxiety. OCS and others say that grades don't really matter, but that's not the truth, especially for those that are less privileged and are trying to use better grades to overcome unconscious bias or discrimination. "
10/10/2019 11:13:30,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:14:35,Yes,"Having letter grades as opposed to a P, High Pass, Fail, imposes MUCH more stress! Friends at schools without letter grades seem much less stressed and able to focus on more than simply grades."
10/10/2019 11:14:37,Yes,"No grades, like at Harvard and Yale, please."
10/10/2019 11:15:01,No,I like the curve and it’s very generous.  It’s hard to get less than a B-.  That doesn’t seem like a relevant stressor to me.
10/10/2019 11:15:11,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:16:23,Yes,"The innate pressure many law students face, particularly students at the caliber of NYU Law, is in my opinion enough to get rid of extra factors that increase external pressures such as grading and ranking. I appreciate the holistic approach NYU takes to building it's community but switching to a pass/fail grading system would be putting their money where their mouth is. Other ""top"" schools have switched to this policy and I believe it would help students focus on the material and conceptual aspects of the legal system, not on the grade at the end of the semester. 

In short, we've all worked hard enough to get here, and the vast majority of us will put our own pressure on ourselves to do well, so why not take administrative action and not add additional pressure. "

10/10/2019 11:24:18,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:25:04,Yes,Its unnecessary stress if they really mean it when they say that we are all good enough here
10/10/2019 11:25:20,Yes,The pressure of doing better than your classmates most of the times makes one lose the objective of learning and gaining knowledge and focus on just competing. The struggle gets tougher to do your learning based on what the professor expects rather than what the subject overall intends to give you. At least in graduate programs this should be avoided. grading is a motivator but grading curve is annoying
10/10/2019 11:26:41,Yes,No grades! Or have a separate track where as a 1L you can opt into a no-grades program. Make everyone chill the fuck outtttt

10/10/2019 11:31:12,Yes,"Even though I find NYU's environment to be less cutthroat than what I've heard about other schools, the strict curve still creates an unhealthy comparison between students. The focus should be on fostering a supportive learning environment, not on ranking us against each other. "
10/10/2019 11:32:24,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:33:08,Yes,the grading curve is too stressful!! I guess everyone who has earned an A should get an A.
10/10/2019 11:33:10,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:36:29,Yes,We don't need a curve. We are a good enough law school that everyone is smart/qualified. The curve only creates stress and big firms will still want to hire NYU students.

10/10/2019 11:40:48,"IDK, but I'm interested in learning more",A less competitive and scaring system may encourage students to focus on the process rather than in the result.

10/10/2019 11:49:50,Yes,"Really depends on what the grading system is. I can see having a pass/fail system, especially during 1L, GREATLY helping to relieve anxiety and stress surrounding grades. As a 3L pursuing a career in public defense, I now only strive for B's in doctrinal classes, partly because it doesn't matter, and partly because caring too much (and failing to meet those expectations) was negatively impacting my emotional well-being. I have never been in a more toxic academic environment than I have been at NYU, and while there are a lot of factors that contribute to this (mainly the overwhelming racism and classism), our grading system and the competitive environment it creates certainly don't help. Clearer policies on class attendance, and not linking class attendance with grades would also be a HUGE help. "

10/10/2019 11:54:17,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:54:55,No,"I've heard anecdotally that, in law schools without letter grading systems, there becomes significant pressure to network with faculty members. In those schools, because students are less able to distinguish themselves through grades, they resort to other ways of trying to distinguish themselves, such as through recommendations. To me, this suggests that the specific grading system employed by NYU is not the issue; the issue is that legal opportunities are inherently limited and law students are strongly motivated to compete for them."
10/10/2019 11:55:00,Yes,
10/10/2019 11:56:18,Yes,"The pressure of the curve added so much anxiety to my daily life. I felt so reduced to numbers and found it really hard to feel confident going into EIW because I had B's. While I know there are flaws to pass/fail system at other schools, I would really love to be part of a conversation where we can at least start a discussion around these issues. The pass/fail system is also an extreme -- I think even midterms would reduce a lot of anxiety and provide some feedback mechanisms so students know what's working and what's not. "

10/10/2019 12:15:26,Yes,"I think, what students more care about is the grade and more specifically, the way of grading. I also found besides grading, the pattern of taking examintation must have the choice or either handwritten or computer based exams, as most of the students came from the jurisdiction have no habit of taking computerized exam and sometimes ends loosing grades because of not able to complete exam on time, that makes them totally mentally sick"
10/10/2019 12:25:04,Yes,I hate everything about the curve and am happy to rant about it at any time should you wish to contact me.
10/10/2019 12:32:05,Yes,"I graduated from a law school ranked in the top 10 in the world and we did not have the curving system. This facilitated healthy relationships among student, not to mention helped us focus on what we were doing as individuals as opposed to what everyone else in the cohort was doing. "
10/10/2019 12:33:38,No,"The pressure on grades comes from external sources: jobs and other professional opportunities. Changing the grading only would have those external forces adapt and to expect whatever the equivalent of an A is. And, the broader a grade band is (ie. like High Pass at Harvard), the more opportunity there is for traditionally powerful communities (white men) to advocate for themselves and stand out over minority students. The problem is law school, not NYU grades. Do not change the system."
10/10/2019 12:35:44,Yes,"A lot of the grading seems pretty arbitrary, and even many professors agree that differences between a B+ and A- for example are essentially nonexistent, but those differences on transcripts have real effects on career choices for students"
10/10/2019 12:35:57,Yes,
10/10/2019 12:39:03,"IDK, but I'm interested in learning more","I do think our grading system is flawed, but I don’t know if I believe any change will make the process less stressful. So long as there is a curve there will be stress, and I don’t see how it would be feasible to change the grading system. It would just shift the “curve” competitive aspect to a differ my part of the process. For me, the main impetus for change would be to improve our education and understanding of the material. I think formative assessments with feedback, spread throughout the semester, would better ensure we were learning the doctrine and support more styles of learning.

10/10/2019 12:59:15,"IDK, but I'm interested in learning more","I think what would help most of all is having more professors driven by a genuine motivation to teach rather than an ignominious desire to inflate their ego and prop up their standing with the brass of the University. I felt personally antagonized by two professors when I attempted to get help on a question during one of the professor’s office hours. 

This put a severe damper on my self esteem and made me question whether I made the right decision to go to this school. 

I’d go into greater detail on precisely what happened, but I’m worried about the potential backlash if word were to get out about the extent of my unfortunate experience. 

I guess paying a fortune to go to this school doesn’t amount to much when trying to gain clarity on a topic that a professor teaches in a very convoluted manner. "
10/10/2019 12:59:50,Yes,I think the curve is really stressful and fosters a competitive environment. 
10/10/2019 13:00:49,Yes,"Of course it would! I imagine a big part of the stress comes from ""competing"" with classmates on a tight curve that only exacerbates the anxiety of a fixed distribution."

10/10/2019 13:36:34,Yes,The majority of all law school stress created in 1L is a result of the fact that all of our grades are based in part on our own performance but also in part on the performance of all of the other students in one's section. IT would be much less stressful to know that my own academic success is based only on my own ability discreetly judged on its merits. 
10/10/2019 13:36:46,Yes,
10/10/2019 13:39:53,Yes,"The grading system is so clearly a part of NYU (and law school in general)'s abusive pedagogy that's focused on ensuring compliance with authority from students in order to mold us all as future lawyers who don't actually work against injustice in any form. When almost all professors are cis white owning class men, or are people who aren't cis white owning class men but who are still deeply invested in upholding white supremacy and cisheteropatriarchy, the grading system inherently favors students who are white, owning class, men. And because grades can correlate with students' earning potential and access to prestigious jobs, the grading system actually further entrenches racial, gender, and class inequality (which is of course NYU's whole game, but feels important to state it explicitly in the context of grading).

Employers judge us by our grades, when those grades are not even a reflection of our mastery of a subject  but of our ability to sneak in a point or two more than our peers. If we want to improve our mental health, if we want to build a culture that fosters collaboration, we need a grading system that actually reflects our knowledge, understanding, hard work and skill.

As a result, I have been told about 1000 times that grades will not matter for me. I have taken this to heart! But, I think the general culture and spirit of law school, and the well-being of individual students, would be much improved by getting rid of the forced curve (I think blind grading might still be a good idea, but that's just a gut instinct)."
10/10/2019 15:25:55,Yes,It’s a constant piece of stress in my mind at all times. I would like the thin that I’m going into debt for to not be reflected by a few letters that influence the rest of my career (and arguably my life if we’re being dramatic).
